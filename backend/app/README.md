# App

The app folder is where all the major logic, routing, models, and flask app setup takes place.
The directories will hold:

* models - Database code and functions to interact with the database
* routes - The routing code and logic for your API
* static - This will only be used if we make it to deployment

Our main important file here is `__init__.py` which will do app creation and setup.
