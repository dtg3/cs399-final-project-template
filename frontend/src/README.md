This is where the bulk of your React app code will live. There is a folder where you can create your
individual components to build up your page content and controls and a new folder called pages. By 
default react is a Single Page Application (SPA) so to break up our program, we let the App.jsx control
"routing" or swapping out our content for the pages we want to see.
